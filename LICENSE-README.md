# License README

Licensing is done on a per-directory basis. Some pieces of the editor are more foundational (e.g.,
`dymium-term`), and we'd like to release them with a more permissive license.

Others are "precious" in a sense - we don't to be taken advantage of by some large corportation due
to an overly permissive license. We are deeply comitted to open-source, and wish that certain
mega-corps shared that view.

## Breakdown

Licensing by directory:

* `dymium-term` - MIT OR Apache-2.0
